//Understanding var,let conts.

//This is what JS does (ignore for now and keep reading)
//var miVariable

//You can either put the ; and the end of the declaration or not, js adds it, but is more conveniente to add it yourself.
//works like let, but this value can't be changed once it is declared.
const novariable = 'este valor es constante';

//js takes it to the beginning of the file and declares ir without the value. It is not used regurlarly
var miVariable = 'variable';

//it is created in the place were it is mentioned for the first time.
let variable = 'variable con let';
